    <ul>
      <li>'no_syn' is the number of synthetic datasets used to generate the statistics i.e. the sample size.</li>
      <li>'no_queries' is the number of queries executed per synthetic dataset, so the total number of queries executed for a specific real datasets equals to: no_queries x no_syn</li>
      <li>If no continuous variable is present in the input datasets, Euclidean distance statistics are shown as NaN.</li>
      <li>If no synthetic dataset is available, statistics are shown as NaN</li>
