Filter Queries
**************
SELECT (variable from parent), (variable from child)
FROM (parent table)
JOIN (child table nam)
    ON (parent key name = child key name)
GROUP BY (variable from parent in the select above)

Aggregate Queries (aggregation allowed by Nominal+Parent variable only)
******************
SELECT (variable from parent), agg_fntn(variable from child)
FROM (parent table)
JOIN (child table nam)
    ON (parent key name = child key name)
GROUP BY (variable from parent in the select above) 


SELECT (variable from parent), agg_fntn(variable from child)
FROM (parent table)
LEFT JOIN (child table nam)
    ON (parent key name = child key name)
GROUP BY

Filter-Aggregate Queries [FILTER BEFORE JOIN using ON] 
******************************************************

SELECT (variable from parent), agg_fntn(variable from child)
FROM (parent table)
JOIN (child table name)
    ON (parent key name = child key name)
    AND (variable from parent or child [cmp_op] specific value )
    ...
GROUP BY (variable from parent in the select above) 

Filter-Aggregate Queries [FILTER AFTER JOIN USING HAVING]
**********************************************
SELECT (variable from parent), agg_fntn(variable from child)
FROM (parent table)
JOIN (child table name)
    ON (parent key name = child key name)
GROUP BY (variable from parent in the select above) 
HAVING [agg_fntn]variable from parent or child [cmp_op] specific value


Filter-Aggregate Queries [FILTER AFTER JOIN using WHERE] 
********************************************************
SELECT (variable from parent), agg_fntn(variable from child)
FROM (parent table)
JOIN (child table name)
    ON (parent key name = child key name)
WHERE [agg_fntn]variable from parent or child [cmp_op] specific value
GROUP BY (variable from parent in the select above) 


We will build
aggregate using ON foreign key and GROUP BY
filter using ON .. AND
filter-aggregate using On ..AND and GROUP BY
